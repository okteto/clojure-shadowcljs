# Get started with Okteto, Clojure and shadow-cljs

This guide is based off https://github.com/christoph-frick/try-shadow-cljs

Steps:
* Launch your clojure development environment: `okteto up`.
* Start your application by running `npm run watch` in your remote development environment.
* Go to http://locahost:8080 in your local browser to see your application.

The development environment is configured to hot reload your changes automatically, using `shadow-cljs` dev server.
